# Alison Full Stack Developer Assessment

This technical assessment evaluates your proficiency in developing a modern full-stack web application using React, Next.js, and PostgreSQL. You will demonstrate your ability to create web application with database integration and efficient data handling.

## Project Overview

You will build a web application that demonstrates your proficiency in:

- Frontend development with React and Next.js
- Raw SQL database operations
- Data visualization
- Form handling and validation

## Technical Requirements

### Environment Setup

- Install Node.js and pnpm using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm)
- Set up a PostgreSQL database using Docker.

```bash
docker run --name postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -p 5432:5432 -d postgres
```

- Choose and implement a database connection method:
  - Direct database connection using [`postgres`](https://github.com/porsager/postgres) or any other client
  - ORM (Prisma, Drizzle, or TypeORM) for schema management and connection only
  - Connection pooling recommended for performance optimization

### Project Requirements

You will need to create a Single Page Application (SPA) with the following technical requirements:

The application should implement client-side routing with two main pages accessible via these routes:

- `/numbers` - For number pair calculations
- `/grades` - For grade management and analysis

Include a top navigation bar that provides navigation between pages

The application can utilize a modern UI component library for consistent design and enhanced user experience. While you have flexibility in choosing any UI library, [Material UI](https://mui.com/) is preferred.

For data fetching and database communication, implement one of these approaches:

- [API Routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) - Create RESTful endpoints in Next.js to handle client-side data fetching with proper error handling and loading states

- [React Server Components (RSC)](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/fetching-data) - Leverage server-side rendering for optimal performance, with streaming capabilities and selective hydration

Ensure your implementation includes proper error boundaries, loading indicators, and responsive design principles regardless of your chosen approach.

#### Numbers Page

Create a form with the following:

- A number input field that accepts both positive and negative integers
- A submit button to save the number to the database

Database Schema:
Table name: "numbers"

- id: number type
- value: number type

Features:

1. Display a table showing pairs of adjacent numbers with their sums
3. Auto-refresh table when new numbers are added
4. Implement proper error handling for database operations

Example table format showing adjacent pairs and their sums:

| ID 1 | Number 1 | ID 2 | Number 2 | Sum |
| ---- | -------- | ---- | -------- | --- |
| 1    | 3        | 2    | 5        | 8   |
| 2    | 5        | 3    | 7        | 12  |
| 3    | 7        | 4    | 2        | 9   |
| 4    | 2        | 5    | -15      | -13 |
| 5    | -15      | 6    | 44       | 29  |

#### Grades Page

Create an interactive form with the following requirements:

- Class name selection via dropdown menu (restricted to Math, Science, History)
- Grade input field (numeric, with built-in validation for range 0-100)
- Submit button

Database Schema:
Table name: "grades"
Columns:

- id: number type
- class: enum type
- grade: number type

Implementation Requirements:

1. Create a data table displaying:
    - ID
   - Class name
   - Grade

2. Implement filter controls:
   - "Show All Data" - Displays complete dataset without filtering
   - "Class Averages" - Calculates and displays average grade per class
   - "Passing Average" - Shows class averages for grades > 55
   - "High Performing Classes" - Lists classes with averages > 70

❗ Each filter button should trigger a dedicated SQL query and automatically update the data displayed in the table with the query results

## Technical Constraints

- Must use **raw SQL** queries for database operations
- ORM usage is allowed only for schema creation and seeding, but all data operations must use raw SQL queries

## Bonus Points

- Unit and integration tests
- Performance optimizations
- Input validation
- Error boundary implementation

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine
3. Install dependencies: `pnpm install`
4. Start PostgreSQL: Use the Docker command above
5. Run development server: pnpm dev
6. Access the application: <http://localhost:3000>

## Submission Guidelines

- Ensure all features are working
- Include database schema
- Document any assumptions or decisions made during development
- Push your code to your forked repository
- Notify us once you have completed the assessment
